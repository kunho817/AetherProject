# Basic Resource System

## Core Resources

### 1. Stardust (Primary Resource)

**Purpose**: The fundamental currency of the Glare Layer

**Generation**:
- Base production: 1 Stardust/second
- Enhanced by: Cosmic Filaments production chain
- Multiplied by: Starburst effects, upgrades, constellation bonuses

**Usage**:
- Purchase Cosmic Filaments
- Fuel certain upgrades
- Trigger for Starburst and Starlight resets

**Number Range**: 0 to 1e100+ (reset triggers)

### 2. Starlight (Prestige Currency)

**Purpose**: Premium currency for major upgrades and unlocks

**Generation**:
- Gained through Starlight resets (1 per reset initially)
- Enhanced by: Rail Road system bonuses
- Modified by: Memory system multipliers

**Usage**:
- Unlock new systems (Nebula, Pulsation, Rail Road)
- Purchase powerful upgrades
- Enhance Star Memory slots
- Fuel condensation system

**Accumulation**: Persistent across most resets

### 3. Star Rail (Secondary Currency)

**Purpose**: Navigation and constellation system currency

**Generation**:
- Formula: `Math.floor((starlightGained / 10) ** 0.5)` minimum 1
- Generated during Starlight resets
- Enhanced by constellation discoveries

**Usage**:
- Navigate Rail Road network
- Unlock constellation effects
- Purchase path enhancements
- Access special stations

**Strategic Value**: Links progression systems together

### 4. Stellar Energy (Automation Resource)

**Purpose**: Powers Star Pulsation system and automation

**Generation**:
- Passive generation: 1 energy/5 seconds base
- Enhanced by: Pulsation cycle completions
- Boosted by: Observatory upgrades

**Usage**:
- Manual pulsation control (100/250/500 energy costs)
- Automation system power
- Special event triggers
- Emergency system activations

**Regeneration**: Continuous passive generation

### 5. Nebular Essence (Grid Currency)

**Purpose**: Nebula Grid system progression

**Generation**:
- Grid pattern completion bonuses
- Essence harvesting from placed patterns
- Enhanced by constellation synergies

**Usage**:
- Expand Nebula Grid size
- Place advanced pattern types
- Unlock pattern variants
- Purchase grid enhancements

**Strategic Use**: Spatial planning resource

### 6. Cosmic Fragment (Rare Resource)

**Purpose**: High-end upgrades and special unlocks

**Generation**:
- Rare drops from high-tier filament operations
- Special event rewards
- Achievement bonuses
- Condensation system yields

**Usage**:
- Rare upgrade purchases
- Unlock hidden mechanics
- Boost condensation efficiency
- Access secret content

**Rarity**: Limited availability drives strategic decisions

## Resource Interactions

### Primary Flow
```
Stardust → Cosmic Filaments → More Stardust (exponential)
                ↓
         Starburst Reset → Multipliers
                ↓
         Starlight Reset → Star Rail + Starlight
                ↓
         System Unlocks → Nebular Essence, Stellar Energy
```

### Cross-System Synergies

**Stardust ↔ Starlight**:
- Stardust accumulation triggers Starlight resets
- Starlight enhances Stardust production through upgrades

**Star Rail ↔ Constellation Effects**:
- Star Rail enables constellation navigation
- Constellations provide bonuses affecting all resources

**Stellar Energy ↔ Pulsation Cycles**:
- Energy powers manual pulsation control
- Pulsation cycles generate more energy and bonuses

**Nebular Essence ↔ Grid Patterns**:
- Essence places and enhances grid patterns
- Patterns generate more essence and global bonuses
