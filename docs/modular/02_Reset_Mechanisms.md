# Reset Mechanisms and Number System

## Core Reset Philosophy

Aether Project uses strategic resets as the primary progression mechanism. Each reset type serves a specific purpose in the player's journey and offers different benefits and trade-offs.

## Reset Types

### 1. Starburst (Initial Soft Reset)

**Purpose**: Unlock new tiers and gain production multipliers

**Reset Targets**:
- Cosmic Filaments (all tiers reset to 0)
- Stardust (reset to 0)

**Retained Elements**:
- Upgrades (all purchased upgrades)
- Rail Road progress (stations and paths)
- Nebula/Star Echo placement
- Star Pulsation settings
- Accumulated Starlight

**Benefits**:
- Production multiplier effect applied
- Higher tier filament unlock
- Starburst-specific bonuses

**Conditions** (Updated):
- 1st Starburst: Purchase Tier 4 filament OR reach 1e20 Stardust
- 2nd-4th: Progressive requirements, x2 multiplier each
- 5th-8th: Enhanced requirements, x3 multiplier each
- 9th+: 50+(5Ã—count) Remnant Filaments required

### 2. Starlight (Extensive Soft Reset)

**Purpose**: Major progression jumps and system unlocks

**Reset Targets**:
- Starburst count (reset to 0)
- Cosmic Filaments (all tiers)
- Stardust (reset to 0)
- Nebula placement (grid cleared)
- Upgrades (most upgrades reset)
- Rail Road progress (paths reset)

**Retained Elements**:
- Accumulated Starlight
- Items preserved by Star Memory System
- Core unlocks (tier access)

**Benefits**:
- Base production increase
- Additional system unlock
- New game mechanism introduction
- Star Rail currency generation

**Trigger Conditions**:
- Reach 1e100 Stardust
- Required for constellation changes
- Required for major upgrade path switches

### 3. Supernova (Nova Layer Preparation)

**Purpose**: Transition to next layer

**Reset Targets**:
- Starburst count
- Cosmic Filaments (all tiers)
- Stardust
- Nebula placements
- Rail Road progress
- Star Pulsation settings

**Retained Elements**:
- Condensation investment
- Accumulated Starlight
- Nova preparation progress

**Benefits**:
- Nova preparation quest progress
- Nova energy condensation enhancement
- Layer transition mechanics

**Usage Timing**:
- Used during Nova condensation phenomenon
- Requires 100+ Starlight investment
- Triggered when ready for layer transition

## Number System

### Large Number Handling

**Library**: break_eternity.js for numbers beyond JavaScript limits

**Range Support**:
- Standard: 1 to 1e308 (JavaScript max)
- Extended: 1e308 to 1e10000+ (break_eternity)
- Notation: Scientific notation (1.23e45)

**Formatting Standards**:
- Small numbers: 1,234 (comma notation)
- Medium numbers: 1.23K, 1.23M, 1.23B
- Large numbers: 1.23e45 (scientific)
- Extreme numbers: e1.23e5 (double scientific)

### Precision Management

**Decimal Precision**: 
- Display: 3 significant digits maximum
- Calculation: Full precision maintained internally
- Rounding: Standard mathematical rounding

**Performance Optimization**:
- Efficient comparison operations
- Cached calculated values
- Lazy evaluation for expensive operations

## Strategic Implications

### Early Game (First 10 Starbursts)
- Focus on understanding reset timing
- Learn which resources to prioritize
- Develop intuition for multiplier stacking

### Mid Game (10-50 Starbursts)
- Master the interplay between systems
- Optimize reset strategies for specific goals
- Balance short-term gains vs. long-term power

### Late Game (50+ Starbursts)
- Plan complex multi-reset strategies
- Coordinate across all systems simultaneously
- Prepare for layer transition mechanics

## Quality of Life Features

### Reset Safety

- Preview of gains before committing
- Undo protection for accidental resets
- Clear indication of what will be lost/kept

### Progress Tracking
- Visual progress bars for reset conditions
- Estimate time to next reset opportunity
- Historical reset log for learning
- Achievement tracking for milestones

### Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly reset buttons
- Clear visual hierarchy for decisions
- Performance optimization for calculations
- Efficient number formatting for small screens
