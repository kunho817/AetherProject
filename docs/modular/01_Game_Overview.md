# Game Overview - Aether Project

## Core Design Philosophy

Aether Project is an incremental game that provides complexity and strategic depth from the beginning, with difficulty scaling geometrically as you progress to late game. Designed for gamers who prefer complex mechanisms, it combines elements from Antimatter Dimensions and The Modding Tree.

## Glare Layer Theme

Glare Layer is the game's first layer, themed around stellar evolution and cosmic energy flow. Players manage stellar energy, develop cosmic filaments, and harness the power of constellations to ultimately evolve to the next layer through supernova explosions.

## Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Resource Generation**: Collect Stardust through Cosmic Filaments
2. **Strategic Resets**: Use Starburst and Starlight for progression multipliers
3. **System Mastery**: Unlock and optimize Nebula, Rail Road, and Pulsation systems
4. **Long-term Planning**: Build toward Nova Layer transition through Condensation

## Target Audience

- **Incremental Game Veterans**: Players familiar with complex idle mechanics
- **Strategy Enthusiasts**: Those who enjoy optimizing interconnected systems
- **Long-term Players**: Designed for hundreds of hours of engagement
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Accessible on both desktop and mobile devices

## Unique Features

- **Dual Progression**: Multiple viable strategies for advancement
- **System Synergy**: Interconnected mechanics that reward understanding
- **Visual Excellence**: Star Map visualization with particle effects
- **Strategic Depth**: Meaningful choices at every stage
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Features unlock naturally through play
