# Starburst Condition Changes

## Overview
Revised Starburst conditions and mechanics to provide better game progression, clearer requirements, and more strategic depth.

## Updated Starburst Conditions

### 1. First Starburst (Breakthrough)
- **Previous**: Simple stardust threshold
- **Current**: Dual condition system
  - **Option A**: Purchase first Tier 4 filament (Horsehead Nebula)
  - **Option B**: Reach 1e20 Stardust
- **Rationale**: Provides multiple progression paths and rewards exploration

### 2. Early Starbursts (2nd-4th)
- **Condition**: Progressive filament tier requirements
- **Benefits**: Each unlocks additional filament tier
- **Multiplier**: x2 per Starburst (cumulative up to x16)
- **Strategic Value**: Establishes basic progression rhythm

### 3. Mid-Game Starbursts (5th-8th)
- **Enhanced Multiplier**: x3 per Starburst (more powerful scaling)
- **Special Unlock**: 5th Starburst unlocks Star Echo System
- **Cumulative Power**: x16 × 3^(count-4) scaling
- **Strategic Depth**: Major power spikes require planning

### 4. Late Game Starbursts (9th+)
- **High-End Requirement**: 50+(5×count) Remnant Filaments (Tier 10)
- **Maximum Unlocks**: 6th Starburst unlocks all 10 tiers
- **Exponential Scaling**: Continued x3 multiplier growth
- **End-Game Focus**: Preparation for layer transitions

## Mechanical Improvements

### Starburst Multiplier Formula
```typescript
// Tiered scaling system
if (starburstCount <= 4) {
  // Early game: x2 per Starburst
  multiplier = D(2).pow(starburstCount)
} else {
  // Late game: x16 base × x3^(count-4)
  const base = D(16) // x2^4 from first 4
  const lateGameMultiplier = D(3).pow(starburstCount - 4)
  multiplier = base.mul(lateGameMultiplier)
}
```

### Enhanced Benefits

#### Upgrade Interactions
- **Time Resonance Upgrade** (4 Starlight): Starburst effect ×5
- **Constellation Resonance** (16 Starlight): Random constellation effect squared per Starburst
- **Dimensional Anchor**: Skip reset every 3rd Starburst (preserves progress)

#### Star Rail Generation
- **During Starburst**: If player can gain Starlight, generate Star Rail
- **Formula**: `Math.floor((starlightGained / 10) ** 0.5)` minimum 1
- **Integration**: Links Starburst to multiple progression systems

## Strategic Implications

### Early Game Strategy
1. **Rush to Tier 4**: Fastest path to first Starburst
2. **Stardust Accumulation**: Alternative path for patient players
3. **Tier Unlocking**: Each Starburst opens new content
4. **Resource Planning**: Balance between immediate gains and long-term power

### Mid-Game Transitions
1. **Star Echo Unlock**: 5th Starburst opens advanced visualization
2. **Multiplier Acceleration**: x3 scaling dramatically increases power
3. **Upgrade Synergy**: Starburst effects amplified by purchases
4. **Strategic Timing**: When to reset vs. when to accumulate

### Late Game Mastery
1. **Tier 10 Focus**: Remnant Filaments become critical
2. **Exponential Requirements**: Each Starburst needs careful planning
3. **Layer Preparation**: Building toward Nova Layer transition
4. **Optimization**: Maximizing efficiency across all systems

## Quality of Life Improvements

### Clear Progression Indicators
- **Visual Feedback**: UI clearly shows next Starburst requirement
- **Multiple Paths**: Players can choose their preferred approach
- **Progress Tracking**: Achievement system tracks Starburst milestones
- **Strategic Information**: Multiplier previews help planning

### Mobile Compatibility
- **Touch-Friendly**: Starburst button optimized for mobile
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear indication of requirements on small screens
- **Performance**: Efficient calculations don't impact mobile performance
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatible descriptions

## Integration with Other Systems

### Achievement System
- **Starburst Tracking**: Dedicated achievements for milestones
- **Speed Achievements**: Time-based Starburst challenges
- **Strategy Achievements**: Rewards for different approaches
- **Progression Rewards**: Bonuses for reaching Starburst counts

### Memory System
- **Preservation Logic**: What gets kept vs. reset
- **Strategic Saving**: Players can preserve key resources
- **Planning Tools**: Memory system helps optimize resets
- **Recovery Assistance**: Faster rebuilding after Starburst

### Automation Integration
- **Auto-Starburst**: Unlocks at 15 Starlight
- **Condition Monitoring**: Automated tracking of requirements
- **Safety Features**: Prevents accidental resets
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Automated timing for maximum benefit

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Starburst Variants**: Different types with unique benefits
- **Conditional Modifiers**: Situational bonuses based on game state
- **Cross-Layer Effects**: Starburst bonuses that persist across layers
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Adaptive requirements based on player skill

### Balance Considerations
- **Power Curve**: Ensuring smooth progression without gaps
- **Choice Meaningfulness**: Multiple viable strategies
- **Catch-Up Mechanisms**: Help for players who fall behind
- **Ceiling Prevention**: Avoiding dominant strategies

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Clearer Progression**: Players understand next steps
2. **Strategic Depth**: Multiple viable approaches
3. **Better Pacing**: Smoother power progression
4. **Enhanced Integration**: Better synergy with other systems
5. **Future-Proof**: Scales well for additional content
6. **Mobile-Friendly**: Works well on all devices
7. **Accessibility**: Clear for players of all skill levels
